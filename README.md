# I'm Daniel Ramírez 👋 & Welcome to my profile!✨  

I'm currently pursuing my Bachelor's degree in Systems Engineering, I'm a student passionate about **Operating Systems, concurrency, and performance**.  
I enjoy programming in C and exploring how memory, processes, and hardware interact with software at a low level.

---

## 💻 What I Do

- Develop programs in C, C++, Python, SQL and Java.  
- Build educational projects focused on performance measurement and modular implementation.  
- I like to go beyond the "black box" — not just *what* works, but *how* and *why* it works.

## 📚 Featured Repositories

- **SistemasOperativos** — Coded in C, looking for performance measurement and a foundation for concurrency using pthreads.
- **Property-Rental-System-DB** — SQL based project, including table normalization and good practices of design
- **UsageOfSomeDataStructures** — Coded in C++, applying usage of linear data structures, trees and graphs

## 🚀 Skills

- **Languages:** C, C++, Java, SQL and Python
- **Tools:** gcc, Makefile, Memory management, Performance measurement  
- **Interests:** concurrency, parallelism, optimization, systems close to hardware (sensors, processes, memory)
