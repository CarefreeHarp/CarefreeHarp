# Welcome to my profile!✨  
I'm Daniel Ramírez 👋

Systems Engineering student passionate about **Operating Systems, concurrency, and performance**.  
I enjoy programming in C and exploring how memory, processes, and hardware interact with software at a low level.

---

## 💻 What I Do

- Develop C programs to deeply understand how memory allocation, processes, and threads work.  
- Build educational projects focused on performance measurement and modular implementation.  
- I like to go beyond the "black box" — not just *what* works, but *how* and *why* it works.

## 📚 Featured Repositories

- **SistemasOperativos** — exercises, challenges, and a lab on matrix multiplication with performance measurement and a foundation for concurrency using pthreads.  
- **Banking-Customer-Management-System** — project oriented towards systems, databases, and object-oriented design.  
- Other work in C++, SQL, and modular programming.

## 🚀 Skills

- **Languages:** C, C++  
- **Tools:** gcc, Makefile, memory management, performance measurement  
- **Interests:** concurrency, parallelism, optimization, systems close to hardware (sensors, processes, memory)
